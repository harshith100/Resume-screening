# Resume-screening
In today's competitive job market, HR professionals and recruiters face the daunting task of efficiently processing and analyzing numerous resumes to identify suitable candidates. Manual resume screening is time-consuming and prone to errors, highlighting the need for automated solutions. This paper addresses the challenge of resume classification using machine learning techniques, presenting a robust framework to categorize resumes based on their content.

The primary objective of our project is to design and implement a robust machine learning pipeline capable of categorizing resumes into relevant job categories automatically. By employing state-of-the-art NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms, we seek to achieve the following objectives:
•	Develop a comprehensive dataset of labeled resumes spanning multiple job categories.
•	Preprocess the textual data to remove noise and standardize the format for feature extraction.
•	Extract informative features from the cleaned resume text using advanced techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization.
•	Train and evaluate machine learning models, including but not limited to K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and support vector machines (SVM), for accurate classification.
•	Fine-tune the model hyperparameters and optimize the classification performance using techniques such as grid search and cross-validation.
•	Deploy the trained model as a scalable and efficient system for automated resume categorization, accessible via a user-friendly interface or API.
